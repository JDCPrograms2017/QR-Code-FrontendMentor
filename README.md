## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I explored more with Flexbox and how to create inline items within a div to make this nicely stacked design.

### Continued development

I would really like to know more about how to properly size and scale the displayed content for all devices of all screen sizes. That was a big struggle here since I focused mostly on the PC appearance and didn't pay attention to mobile appearance until the last bit.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) - ChatGPT allows me to ask very specific questions when I need a straightforward answer. It definitely helped me figure out little things like how to make a box-shadow.
